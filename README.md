# üëã Hello world! 

I am Jonathan Sharpe, a Seattle Pacific University graduate with a
Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. Below are some projects that
I've worked on.

## üèüÔ∏è Sharpe's Hit List 

This has been an ongoing project for several years now. It exists to track all the major league baseball games I've attended over the years. The project began as a mostly vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript project, but has evolved into one that utilizes a database and API to store and fetch the info needed to display to the user. The website allows the user to filter the games page by different criteria, including the year, team, park, and more. The re-write is a way to improve maintainbility and scalability, as before it was a lot of static HTML that had a lot of duplicated code. There is much less of that now and I'm continuing to find ways to optimize it and implement better programming practices.

## üè´ Software Engineering Project 

During my final year in college, I worked with a team of five other
students to produce a web app. Our university's system for course
registration, course planning, time schedule, and suggested course
sequences was very piecemeal and difficult to use, so we set out to
rectify that with our Graduation Planning App (GPA). While it wasn't
made with the idea that the school would switch to our web app, it was
made to show what a re-imagined system *could* look like. We used
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Vite for the frontend portion, with mySQL
and Node.js running the backend. One of our team members also spent a
lot of time screen-scraping the time schedule on our university's
website, as we were not provided direct access to the data necessary
to make course plans. My time was primarily spent working on the
backend API, ensuring that the requests made from the frontend would
return the necessary data. It essentially was fully functional,
besides the actual course registration part.
[Here](https://youtu.be/aMFmd9eoO_I) is a video demonstrating the app.

## üñ•Ô∏è My dotfiles repo 

I have daily-driven Linux for many years now, and have my dotfiles
in a public repo in case anyone is interested in my setup. It's mostly
just for me at the moment, to sync my config between my two computers,
but at some point I'll likely spruce it up so there's more to see.

Perhaps the most notable thing here is my Neovim config, as I've
been using that for about the same time I've used Linux. It's gotten
me some practice with the Lua programming language, which was
completely unknown to me before using Neovim. I've also of course
learned how to use the command line and how to do some shell
scripting, which I'm continuing to learn more about as I find ways to
optimize my workflow.

## ‚å®Ô∏è Other interests 

Like most programmers, I use a mechanical keyboard, and have a small collection. I really appreciate QMK for helping make layout customization easier, though it is difficult to use for non-programming nerds. Vial has helped bridge the gap by providing a more GUI-based approach with the QMK features so it's easier for people to customize their layout.

I enjoy Minecraft, and am currently exploring getting into the modding scene, likely starting by contributing to existing projects. It's all new to me but since it's something that's very relevant to my interests I think I will be especially motivated to work on it.

## ü§î What's next? 

Sharpe's Hit List is the main project, as it's something I'll work on
regularly from time to time. I want to work on contributing to open-source projects, as personally I don't have many ideas of things to create myself, but I want to help contribute to the community in some way.
